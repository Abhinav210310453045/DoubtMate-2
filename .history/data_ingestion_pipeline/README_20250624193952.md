# Data Ingestion Pipeline

This directory contains the Data Ingestion Pipeline for the DoubtMate application suite.

## Overview
The pipeline is responsible for ingesting, processing, and storing data efficiently. It is designed to work seamlessly with other components of the DoubtMate suite.

## Docker Compose Management
Below is a summary table for managing Docker Compose containers and data. These commands help you safely start, stop, and manage your containers and associated data.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Action                   | Command                        | Container | Data |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|:--------:|:----:|
| Start safely             | `docker-compose up -d`         |   ✅      |  ✅  |
| Stop safely              | `docker-compose stop`           |   ✅      |  ✅  |
| Resume after stop        | `docker-compose start`          |   ✅      |  ✅  |
| Stop + remove container  | `docker-compose down`           |   ❌      |  ✅  |
| Full wipe (dangerous)    | `docker-compose down -v`        |   ❌      |  ❌  |

- **Container**: Indicates if the container is preserved (✅) or removed (❌).
- **Data**: Indicates if the data is preserved (✅) or removed (❌).

### Command Details
- **Start safely**: Brings up the containers in detached mode, preserving data.
- **Stop safely**: Stops the containers without removing them or the data.
- **Resume after stop**: Restarts stopped containers, data remains intact.
- **Stop + remove container**: Stops and removes containers, but keeps data volumes.
- **Full wipe (dangerous)**: Stops and removes containers and deletes all data volumes. Use with caution!

## Directory Structure
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for the pipeline.
- `main.py`: Main entry point for the data ingestion process.
- `src/`: Source code for modules, agents, and helpers.
- `test/`: Test cases for the pipeline.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `data_ingestion_pipeline` directory.
3. Use the commands in the summary table above to manage your pipeline containers.

## Requirements
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python (see `requirements.txt` for dependencies)
